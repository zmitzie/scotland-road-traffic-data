# Project 2 - Group plan

In your first meeting, discuss and record a quick note of your agreed answers to the following questions:

- When and how often will you meet as a group? Will you use Zoom, Teams, something else?
  - Regular meetings on Tue, 17:00-18:00 UK Time
  - Drop-In Sessions on Wed afternoon
  - Option for additional meeting on Fri


- How will you communicate outside of your meetings (email, Teams, Discord, group chat...)?
  - Meetings in Teams
  - General communication in WhatsApp


- Is everyone comfortable with using git/GitHub? If not, one person could demonstrate for the group during your first meeting; if nobody is comfortable, ask on Piazza or email Charlotte!
  - Yes.
  - Everyone has their own folder with personal files. We try to work on our own files and create a final file out of these.

- Discuss your ideas for questions to investigate. Are there questions in the suggestions which you find interesting? Do you have new ideas of your own? You can keep a note of these ideas here.
  - Work on 'ideas to get started'
  - Come up with new ideas while working on the project



- How do you want to divide the tasks? Are you planning to pair-program?
  - Hybrid Structure: Each one tries to solve their assigned tasks on their own. However, if difficulties occur, we want to solve them in pair-programming style or within the team meetings.
